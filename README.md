# This Recommendation System is Broken   
"If you like this, you might also like…" such algorithmic recommendation systems have become ubiquitous in online platforms. 
And yet A.I.-driven processes of content personalization often bear biases and limitations. 
This Recommendation System is Broken upends the expectations of carefully-automated choice, surfacing suggestions from the vast
body of undervalued, hidden, unseen artworks in the museum collection. In her project, Giulia Taurino challenges the public 
to rethink museum collections in terms of visible and in-visible objects, by inviting us to explore what we might call 
"brokenness" in recommendation systems and to reconsider our understanding of marginalized art history.

Lightbox Gallery (Level 5), Harvard Art Museums

Curatorial A(i)gents presents a series of machine-learning-based experiments with museum collections and data developed 
by members and affiliates of metaLAB (at) Harvard, a creative research group working in the networked arts and humanities. 
Long before computers came to pervade every aspect of modern life, museums were collecting, organizing, and storing data. 
The art museum is a kind of vast machine for making all kinds of objects interoperable, from bronze-age figurines to 
Renaissance paintings to contemporary performance-art works. Like our digital machines, museums engender wonderful 
experiences—and they’re also engines of bias, power, and invisibility. The term “machine learning” represents a family 
of systems that use algorithms to find patterns in data inferentially, without explicit instructions. Artists and media 
makers are experimenting with machine-learning tools to create new kinds of artworks. But roles for machine learning in 
the art museum are still rare in practice. Presented in the Lightbox Gallery, metaLAB’s projects explore emerging 
possibilities for machine-learning systems while exploring vital issues at the intersection of technology and culture. 
Variously playful, analytic, and critical, metaLAB’s experiments use the museums’ own data to expressive ends. 
The names and dates of works and their makers; curatorial descriptions and histories of exhibitions; colors and dimensions; 
images of objects themselves—encountering such data as these, algorithms chart invisible relations, forge new connections, 
and breed monsters.
